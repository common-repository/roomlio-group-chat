Roomlio is a chat platform that allows you to embed a chat room anywhere in your existing Wordpress pages and posts.

== Description ==
Roomlio is an embeddable chat platform. It allows you to simply and quickly embed a chat room anywhere on your Wordpress pages or posts. It differs from existing chat applications because it focuses on embedding group chat 
rooms in existing pages instead of sending your users off to a 3rd part chat application. You can think of it as offering 
embeddable "Twitch style" or "Youtube style" chat for your Wordpress users and visitors. Although Roomlio focuses on embedding chat rooms inside of Wordpress, it still provides an app 
for admins and operators to manage all the embedded channels and chat with embedded users.

== Features ==

- Keep your users on your site/domain while chatting. Roomlio branding can be hidden for a seemless experience. Maintain your brand by not sending users to external chat applications.
- Automatically securely identify your logged in Wordpress users. No separate login required. (If users are not logged in they will be identified based on geolocation)
- No code required. Our plugin lets you place chat room widgets where you want them in a user friendly way.
- Unlimited chat rooms. Create as many as you want, we don't restrict that.
- Unlimited chat history
- Admin app. Manage all the rooms you create in one place using our dedicated Admin app (Works on all major operating systems, Windows, Mac, iOS and Android).
- Customize the appearance/size of your rooms.
- Support for images/gifs.
- Offline mode. Allow visitors to leave an offline message (optionally forwarded to email) if your room is in offline mode.
